# Advanced AI Image Classifier & Editor

A great little app built with **Streamlit** that lets you upload an image to get quick AI predictions and gives you simple tools to edit and optimize your pictures.

---

## Project Overview
This project is designed to make both **image classification** and **basic photo editing** super easy for everyone.  
Just upload any picture, and the app instantly tells you what it likely contains using a fast and efficient deep learning model.  

- Shows the **top three predictions** with confidence scores.  
- Provides **useful insights** like dominant color, brightness, sharpness, and dimensions.  
- Includes a **new editing section** where you can resize, compress, rotate, or flip images.  
- All processed images can be **downloaded instantly and free of cost**.  

It is built to be simple, fast, and practical for testing, learning, or quickly optimizing your photos.
